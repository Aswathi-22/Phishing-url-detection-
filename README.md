# Phishing-url-detection-
Phishing URL Detection is a machine learning project using LSTM-based RNNs to classify URLs as phishing or legitimate. It extracts key features, is trained on datasets from PhishTank and CommonCrawl, and is deployed as a Streamlit web app for real-time detection. Future plans include browser integration and enhanced accuracy.
